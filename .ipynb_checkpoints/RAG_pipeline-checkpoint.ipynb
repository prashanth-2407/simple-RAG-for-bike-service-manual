      "Answer: 1. The bike, model 3-13EAU10411, has a single cylinder engine with a displacement of 155 cm³.\n",
      "2. It is equipped with a liquid-cooled SOHC (Single Overhead Camshaft) engine and uses regular unleaded gasoline (Gasohol [E10] acceptable).\n",
      "3. The bike has a 6-speed constant mesh transmission with a primary reduction ratio of 3.042 and a final drive chain.\n",
      "4. Its dimensions are: overall length - 1990 mm (78.3 in), overall width - 725 mm (28.5 in), overall height - 1135 mm (44.7 in), seat height - 815 mm (32.1 in), wheelbase - 1325 mm (52.2 in), ground clearance - 170 mm (6.69 in), and minimum turning radius - 2.8 m (9.19 ft).\n",
      "5. The bike weighs approximately 137 kg (302 lb) with a fuel tank capacity of 11 L (2.9 US gal, 2.4 Imp.gal) and a reserve amount of 1.9 L (0.50 US gal, 0.42 Imp.gal).\n",
      "6. The spark plug model used is NGK/MR8E9 with a gap of 0.8–0.9 mm (0.031–0.035 in).\n",
      "7. The recommended engine oil for this bike is YAMALUBE SAE viscosity grades: 10W-40, API service SG type or higher, JASO standard MA. The oil change interval is approximately every 6000 km (3728 miles).\n",
