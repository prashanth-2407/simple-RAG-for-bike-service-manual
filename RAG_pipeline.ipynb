      "Answer: Based on the provided context, which details the specifications and components of a motorcycle with the model code UB9BEYE, here are some interesting facts about this bike:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Model and Year**: The bike is from the year 2017, as indicated by the document creation date (Wednesday, August 2, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dimensions**: It has an overall length of 1990 mm (78.3 in), overall width of 725 mm (28.5 in), overall height of 1135 mm (44.7 in), and a seat height of 815 mm (32.1 in). The ground clearance is 170 mm (6.69 in), which helps in navigating over obstacles without scraping the underside of the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wheelbase**: The wheelbase measures 1325 mm (52.2 in), which contributes to the bike's stability and handling characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Engine Capacity and Type**: The bike is powered by a single-cylinder, 4-stroke, SOHC engine with a displacement of 155 cm³. It has a bore x stroke of 58.0 × 58.7 mm (2.28 × 2.31 in) and a compression ratio of 11.6:1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cooling System**: The engine is liquid-cooled, which helps in maintaining optimal operating temperatures for performance and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Starting System**: It features an electric starter for convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Lubrication System**: The engine uses a wet sump system to lubricate its components.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Recommended Engine Oil**: The bike requires 10W-40 oil, and the recommended brand is YAMALUBE. It adheres to API service SG type or higher and JASO MA standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Fuel System**: It runs on regular unleaded gasoline (Gasohol [E10] acceptable), with a fuel tank capacity of 11 liters (2.9 US gallons, 2.4 Imp. gallons).\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Air Filter**: The bike uses a dry element air filter, which is important for air intake and engine performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Fuel Injection**: The throttle body ID mark is B9B1 00, indicating the specific part number for servicing or replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Clutch**: The wet, multiple-disc clutch is designed to provide a smooth engagement and better control over the power delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Drivetrain**: The bike has a primary reduction ratio of 3.042 (73/24) and uses a chain for the final drive with a secondary reduction ratio of 3.429 (48/14). It features a 6-speed constant mesh transmission, offering a range of gear ratios for different riding conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. **Performance**: The gear ratios are optimized to provide a balance between acceleration and top speed, with the first gear designed for easy takeoff and the sixth gear for highway cruising.\n",
      "\n",
      "These facts encompass various aspects of the bike's design, performance, and maintenance specifications, which can be crucial information for owners or enthusiasts looking to understand or service their motorcycle.\n"
